# furniture
The furniture R package contains functions to help create summary tables for academic publication. It currently contains five main functions:

1. `table1()` -- gives a well-formatted table for academic publication of descriptive statistics. Very useful for quick analyses as well.
2. `tableX()` -- gives model summaries of several "lm" and "glm" models simultaneously
3. `frames()` -- produces average marginal effects
4. `tp()` -- performs a two-part model for zero inflated count data
5. `tp2frames()` -- takes a tp object and gives the combined average marginal effects

Overall, the package should be useful for social scientists working on quantitative research.
