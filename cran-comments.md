Hi, this release is in part to support new changes to the upcoming 
dplyr release as well as add new features and bug fixes.
Currently, there is one downstream dependency for this package
(`MarginalMediation`). This package has been checked with no errors,
warnings, or notes resulting from the changes to the `furniture` package.
