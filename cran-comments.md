## Test environments
* local Mac OS X, R 3.3.1
* Ubuntu 12.04 (through Travis-CI)
* Win-Builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There was 1 NOTE (none in Mac/Ubuntu and 1 in Windows):

* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE Maintainer: 'Tyson Barrett <t.barrett@aggiemail.usu.edu>'

This is certainly not an issue, rather an automatically produced NOTE when using Win-Builder.
