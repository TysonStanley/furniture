Hi, this release is in part to support new changes to the upcoming 
dplyr release as well as new features and bug fixes.
Currently, there are 2 downstream dependencies (`MarginalMediation`, `TDIagree`)
for this package and neither are affected by the changes. This package has 
been checked with no errors, warnings, or notes resulting from the 
changes to the `furniture` package.
