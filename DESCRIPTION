Description: Contains four main functions (i.e., four pieces of furniture):
    table1() which produces a well-formatted table of descriptive statistics common as Table 1
    in research articles, tableC() which produces a well-formatted table of correlations,
    tableF() which provides frequency counts, and washer() which 
    is helpful in cleaning up the data. These furniture-themed functions are designed 
    to simplify common tasks in quantitative analysis. Other data summary and cleaning tools 
    are also available.
