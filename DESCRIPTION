Description: Package contains two main functions (i.e., two pieces of furniture):
    table1() which produces a well-formatted table of descriptives common in
    research articles; and washer() which is helpful in cleaning up your data.
    Should be useful for quantitative research in applied fields (e.g., health,
    behavioral, and social sciences). It also contains a simple operator to 
    help with data exploration.
