Description: Contains three main functions (i.e., three pieces of furniture):
    table1() which produces a well-formatted table of descriptives common as Table 1
    in research articles, tableC() which produces a well-formatted table of correlations,
    and washer() which is helpful in cleaning up the data. In addition,
    long() and wide(), built on the stats::reshape(), can help reformat the data.
    These furniture functions are designed to simplify common tasks in 
    quantitative analysis. Other data summary and cleaning tools are also available.
