Description: Contains two main functions (i.e., two pieces of furniture):
    table1() which produces a well-formatted table of descriptives common as Table 1
    in research articles and washer() which is helpful in cleaning up your data. 
    These furniture functions are designed to simplify common tasks in 
    quantitative analysis.
