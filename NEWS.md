# First Release

We are excited to announce that we have our first release. The furniture package is now on CRAN (package version 1.0.1)! This means you can install the stable package via:

```r
install.packages("furniture")
```

The developmental version found on GitHub, has been upgraded to version 1.1.0 which includes two new operators (`%on%` and `%xt%`). 

* `%on%` is nearly identical to `%in%` except that it also can use quoted expressions (e.g., ">= 10").
* `%xt%` does simple cross tabulations and prints the chi-square test of independence.

Thanks for following!
