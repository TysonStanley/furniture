\usage{
table1(.data, ..., splitby = NULL, FUN = NULL, FUN2 = NULL,
  second = NULL, row_wise = FALSE, test = FALSE, type = NULL,
  rounding_perc = 1, var_names = NULL, format_number = FALSE,
  NAkeep = FALSE, booktabs = TRUE, caption = NULL, align = NULL,
  export = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{the data.frame that is to be summarized}

\item{...}{variables in the data set that are to be summarized; unquoted names separated by commas (e.g. age, gender, race) or indices. If indices, it needs to be a single vector (e.g. c(1:5, 8, 9:20) instead of 1:5, 8, 9:20). As it is currently, it CANNOT handle both indices and unquoted names simultaneously.}

\item{splitby}{the categorical variable to stratify by in formula form (e.g., \code{splitby = ~gender}) or quoted (e.g., \code{splitby = "gender"}); not too surprisingly, it requires that the number of levels be > 0}

\item{FUN}{the function to be applied to summarize the numeric data; default is to report the means and standard deviations}

\item{FUN2}{a secondary function to be applied to summarize the numeric data; default is to report the medians and 25\% and 75\% quartiles}

\item{second}{a vector or list of continuous variables for which the \code{FUN2} should be applied}

\item{row_wise}{how to calculate percentages for factor variables when \code{splitby != NULL}: if \code{FALSE} calculates percentages by variable within groups; if \code{TRUE} calculates percentages across groups for one level of the factor variable.}

\item{test}{logical; if set to \code{TRUE} then the appropriate bivariate tests of significance are performed if splitby has more than 1 level}

\item{type}{a string or a vector of strings; used to define how values will be displayed. Three main sections can be inputted: 1. if test = TRUE, can write "pvalues", "full", or "stars", 2. can state "simple" and/or "condense", 3. can add the type of output (e.g., "text", "latex", "html", etc.). These are discussed in more depth in the details section below.}

\item{rounding_perc}{the number of digits after the decimal for percentages; default is 1}

\item{var_names}{custom variable names to be printed in the table}

\item{format_number}{default in FALSE; if TRUE, then the numbers are formatted with commas (e.g., 20,000 instead of 20000)}

\item{NAkeep}{when sset to \code{TRUE} it also shows how many missing values are in the data for each categorical variable being summarized}

\item{booktabs}{when \code{output_type != "text"}; option is passed to \code{knitr::kable}}

\item{caption}{when \code{output_type != "text"}; option is passed to \code{knitr::kable}}

\item{align}{when \code{output_type != "text"}; option is passed to \code{knitr::kable}}

\item{export}{character; when given, it exports the table to a CSV file to folder named "table1" in the working directory with the name of the given string (e.g., "myfile" will save to "myfile.csv")}
}
\value{
A table with the number of observations, means/frequencies and standard deviations/percentages is returned. The object is a \code{table1} class object with a print method. Can be printed in \code{LaTex} form.
}
\description{
Produces a descriptive table, stratified by an optional categorical variable, 
providing means/frequencies and standard deviations/percentages. 
It is well-formatted for easy transition to academic article or report. 
Can be used within the piping framework [see library(magrittr)].
}
\details{
In defining \code{type}, 1. options are "pvalues" that display the p-values of the tests, "full" which also shows the test statistics, or "stars" which only displays stars to highlight significance with *** < .001 ** .01 * .05;
2. "simple" then only percentages are shown for categorical variable and
"condense" then continuous variables' means and SD's will be on the same line as the variable name and dichotomous variables only show counts and percentages for the reference category;
3. default is "text", with a slight variant of "text2". The other options are all format options in the \code{kable()} function in \code{knitr} (e.g., latex, html, markdown, pandoc) as well as "text2" which adds a line below the header in the table.

\examples{
## Ficticious Data ##
library(furniture)
library(tidyverse)

x  <- runif(1000)
y  <- rnorm(1000)
z  <- factor(sample(c(0,1), 1000, replace=TRUE))
a  <- factor(sample(c(1,2), 1000, replace=TRUE))
df <- data.frame(x, y, z, a)

## Simple
table1(df, x, y, z, a)

## Stratified
## both below are the same
table1(df, x, y, z,
       splitby = ~ a)
table1(df, x, y, z,
       splitby = "a")

## With Piping
df \%>\%
  table1(x, y, z, 
         splitby = ~a) \%>\%
  summarise(count = n())

## Adjust variables within function
table1(df, ifelse(x > 0, 1, 0), z,
       var_names = c("X2", "Z"))
