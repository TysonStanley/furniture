\description{
The furniture package offers simple functions (i.e. pieces of furniture) and an 
operator that are aimed at helping applied researchers explore and communicate 
their data as well as clean their data in a tidy way. The package follows similar 
semantics to the "tidyverse" packages. It contains two main tools (along with an 
operator):
\itemize{
  \item \code{table1} provides a well-formatted descriptive table often seen 
        as table 1 in academic journals,
  \item \code{washer} provides a simple way to clean up data where there are placeholder
        values, and
  \item \code{\%xt\%} is an operator that takes two factor variables and creates a cross tabulation and
        tests for significance via a chi-square test.
}
}
\details{
Table 1 is the main function in furniture. It is useful in both data exploration 
and data communication. With minimal cleaning, the outputted table can be put into 
an academic, peer reviewed journal manuscript. As such, it is very useful in exploring
your data when you have a stratifying variable. For example, if you are exploring whether
the means of several demographic and behavioral characteristics are related to a health condition,
the health condition (i.e. "yes" or "no"; "low", "mid", or "high"; or a list of conditions) as
the stratifying variable. With little code, you can test for associations and check means or 
counts by the stratifying variable. See the vignette for more information.
