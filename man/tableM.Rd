\usage{
tableM(.data, ..., all = FALSE, missing_var = NULL, row_wise = FALSE,
  splitby_labels = NULL, medians = NULL, test = FALSE,
  test_type = "default", simple = FALSE, condense = FALSE,
  piping = FALSE, rounding = 2, var_names = NULL,

  align = NULL, export = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{the data.frame that is to be summarized}

\item{...}{variables in the data set that are to be summarized; unquoted names separated by commas (e.g. age, gender, race) or indices. If indices, it needs to be a single vector (e.g. c(1:5, 8, 9:20) instead of 1:5, 8, 9:20). As it is currently, it CANNOT handle both indices and unquoted names simultaneously.}

\item{all}{logical; if set to \code{TRUE} all variables in the dataset are used. If there is a stratifying variable then that is the only variable excluded.}

\item{row_wise}{how to calculate percentages for factor variables when \code{splitby != NULL}: if \code{FALSE} calculates percentages by variable within groups; if \code{TRUE} calculates percentages across groups for one level of the factor variable.}

\item{splitby_labels}{allows for custom labels of the splitby levels; must match the number of levels of the splitby variable}

\item{medians}{a vector or list of continuous variables for which medians and 25\% and 75\% quartiles should be produced}

\item{test}{logical; if set to \code{TRUE} then the appropriate bivariate tests of significance are performed if splitby has more than 1 level}

\item{test_type}{has two options: "default" performs the default tests of significance only; "or" also give unadjusted odds ratios as well based on logistic regression (only use if splitby has 2 levels)}

\item{simple}{logical; if set to \code{TRUE} then only percentages are shown for categorical variables.}

\item{condense}{logical; if set to \code{TRUE} then continuous variables' means and SD's will be on the same line as the variable name and dichotomous variables only show counts and percentages for the reference category}

\item{piping}{if \code{TRUE} then the table is printed and the original data is passed on. It is very useful in piping situations where one wants the table but wants it to be part of a larger pipe.}

\item{rounding}{the number of digits after the decimal for means and SD's; default is 2}

\item{var_names}{custom variable names to be printed in the table}

\item{format_output}{has three options (with partial matching): 1) "full" provides the table with the type of test, test statistic, and the p-value for each variable; 2) "pvalues" provides the table with the p-values; and 3) "stars" provides the table with stars indicating significance}

\item{output_type}{default is "text"; the other options are all format options in the \code{kable()} function in \code{knitr} (e.g., latex, html, markdown, pandoc) as well as "text2" which adds a line below the header in the table.}

\item{format_number}{default in FALSE; if TRUE, then the numbers are formatted with commas (e.g., 20,000 instead of 20000)}

\item{NAkeep}{when sset to \code{TRUE} it also shows how many missing values are in the data for each categorical variable being summarized}

\item{m_label}{when \code{NAkeep = TRUE} this provides a label for the missing values in the table}

\item{booktabs}{when \code{output_type != "text"}; option is passed to \code{knitr::kable}}

\item{caption}{when \code{output_type != "text"}; option is passed to \code{knitr::kable}}

\item{align}{when \code{output_type != "text"}; option is passed to \code{knitr::kable}}

\item{export}{character; when given, it exports the table to a CSV file to folder named "table1" in the working directory with the name of the given string (e.g., "myfile" will save to "myfile.csv")}

\item{splitby}{the categorical variable to stratify by in formula form (e.g., \code{splitby = ~gender}) or quoted (e.g., \code{splitby = "gender"}); not too surprisingly, it requires that the number of levels be > 0}
}
\value{
A table with the number of observations, means/frequencies and standard deviations/percentages is returned. The object is a \code{table1} class object with a print method. Can be printed in \code{LaTex} form.
}
\description{
Produces a descriptive table, stratified a variable with missing values, 
providing means/frequencies and standard deviations/percentages. 
It is well-formatted for easy transition to academic article or report. 
Can be used within the piping framework [see library(magrittr)].

\examples{
## Ficticious Data ##
library(furniture)
library(tidyverse)

x  <- runif(1000)
y  <- rnorm(1000)
z  <- factor(sample(c(0,1), 1000, replace=TRUE))
a  <- factor(sample(c(1,2), 1000, replace=TRUE))
df <- data.frame(x, y, z, a)

## Simple
table1(df, x, y, z, a)

## Stratified
## both below are the same
table1(df, x, y, z,
       splitby = ~ a)
table1(df, x, y, z,
       splitby = "a")

## With Piping
df \%>\%
  table1(x, y, z, 
         splitby = ~a, 
         piping = TRUE) \%>\%
  summarise(count = n())

## Adjust variables within function
table1(df, ifelse(x > 0, 1, 0), z,
       var_names = c("X2", "Z"))
