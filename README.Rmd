The furniture R package contains functions to help with data cleaning/tidying (e.g., `washer()`, `rowmeans()`, `rowsums()`), exploratory data analysis and reporting (e.g., `table1()`, `tableC()`, `tableF()`). It currently contains eight main functions:

1. `table1()` -- gives a well-formatted table for academic publication of descriptive statistics. Very useful for quick analyses as well. Notably, `table1()` now works with `dplyr::group_by()`.
2. `tableC()` -- gives a well-formatted table of correlations.
3. `tableF()` -- provides a thorough frequency table for quick checks of the levels of a variable.
4. `washer()` -- changes several values in a variable (very useful for changing place holder values to missing).
5. `long()` -- is a wrapper of `stats::reshape()`, takes the data from wide to long format (long is often the tidy version of the data), works well with the tidyverse, and can handle unbalanced multilevel data.
6. `wide()` -- also a wrapper of `stats::reshape()`, takes the data from long to wide, and like `long()`, works well with the tidyverse and can handle unbalanced multilevel data.
7. `rowmeans()` -- a tidyverse friendly version of `rowMeans()`
8. `rowsums()` -- a tidyverse friendly version of `rowSums()`

In conjunction with many other tidy tools, the package should be useful for health, behavioral, and social scientists working on quantitative research.

# Installation

The latest stable build of the package can be downloaded from CRAN via:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("furniture")
```
You can download the developmental version via:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("tysonstanley/furniture")
```

# Using furniture

The main functions are the `table_()` functions (e.g., `table1()`, `tableC()`, `tableF()`).

```{r}
library(furniture)
data("nhanes_2010")

table1(nhanes_2010,
       age, marijuana, illicit, rehab,
       splitby=~asthma)
```

```{r}
table1(nhanes_2010,
       age, marijuana, illicit, rehab,
       splitby=~asthma, 
       output = "text2")
```

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
nhanes_2010 %>%
  group_by(asthma) %>%
  table1(age, marijuana, illicit, rehab,
         output = "text2")
```

`table1()` can be outputted directly to other formats. All `knitr::kable()` options are available for this and there is an extra option `"latex2"` which provides a publication ready table in Latex documents.

```{r}
tableC(nhanes_2010, 
       age, active, vig_active, 
       na.rm=TRUE)
```

```{r}
tableF(nhanes_2010, age)
```

In addition, the `rowmeans()` and `rowsums()` functions offer a simplified use of `rowMeans()` and `rowSums()`, particularly when using the tidyverse's `mutate()`.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
nhanes_2010 = tibble::as_tibble(nhanes_2010)
```

```{r}
nhanes_2010 %>%
  select(vig_active, mod_active) %>%
  mutate(avg_active = rowmeans(vig_active, mod_active, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(sum_active = rowsums(vig_active, mod_active, na.rm=TRUE))
```


## Notes

The package is most useful in conjunction with other tidy tools to get data cleaned/tidied and start exploratory data analysis. I recommend using packages such as `library(dplyr)`, `library(tidyr)`, and `library(ggplot2)` with `library(furniture)` to accomplish this.

The most important function--`table1`--is simply built for both exploratory descriptive analysis and communication of findings. See vignettes or [tysonstanley.github.io](https://tysonstanley.github.io/) for several examples of its use. Also see our paper in the [R Journal](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2017/RJ-2017-037/RJ-2017-037.pdf).
