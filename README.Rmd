# furniture: `r packageVersion("furniture")` <img src="man/figures/furniture_hex_v2_full.png" align="right" width="40%" height="40%" />

The furniture R package contains functions to help with data cleaning/tidying (e.g., `washer()`, `rowmeans()`, `rowsums()`), exploratory data analysis and reporting (e.g., `table1()`, `tableC()`, `tableF()`). It currently contains eight main functions:

1. `table1()` -- gives a well-formatted table for academic publication of descriptive statistics. Very useful for quick analyses as well. Notably, `table1()` now works with `dplyr::group_by()`.
2. `tableC()` -- gives a well-formatted table of correlations.
3. `tableF()` -- provides a thorough frequency table for quick checks of the levels of a variable.
4. `washer()` -- changes several values in a variable (very useful for changing place holder values to missing).
5. `long()` -- is a wrapper of `stats::reshape()`, takes the data from wide to long format (long is often the tidy version of the data), works well with the tidyverse, and can handle unbalanced multilevel data.
6. `wide()` -- also a wrapper of `stats::reshape()`, takes the data from long to wide, and like `long()`, works well with the tidyverse and can handle unbalanced multilevel data.
7. `rowmeans()` and `rowmeans.n()` -- tidyverse friendly versions of `rowMeans()`, where the `rowmeans.n()` function allows `n` number of missing
8. `rowsums()` and `rowsums.n()` -- tidyverse friendly versions of `rowSums()`, where the `rowsums.n()` function allows `n` number of missing

In conjunction with many other tidy tools, the package should be useful for health, behavioral, and social scientists working on quantitative research.

# Installation

The latest stable build of the package can be downloaded from CRAN via:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("furniture")
```
You can download the developmental version via:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("tysonstanley/furniture")
```

# Using furniture

The main functions are the `table*()` functions (e.g., `table1()`, `tableC()`, `tableF()`).

```{r}
library(furniture)
```

```{r}
data("nhanes_2010")

table1(nhanes_2010,
       age, marijuana, illicit, rehab,
       splitby=~asthma,
       na.rm = FALSE)
```

```{r}
table1(nhanes_2010,
       age, marijuana, illicit, rehab,
       splitby=~asthma, 
       output = "text2",
       na.rm = FALSE)
```

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
nhanes_2010 %>%
  group_by(asthma) %>%
  table1(age, marijuana, illicit, rehab,
         output = "text2",
         na.rm = FALSE)
```

`table1()` can do bivariate significance tests as well.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
nhanes_2010 %>%
  group_by(asthma) %>%
  table1(age, marijuana, illicit, rehab,
         output = "text2",
         na.rm = FALSE,
         test = TRUE)
```

By default it does the appropriate parametric tests. However, you can change that by setting `param = FALSE` (new with `v 1.9.1`).

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
nhanes_2010 %>%
  group_by(asthma) %>%
  table1(age, marijuana, illicit, rehab,
         output = "text2",
         na.rm = FALSE,
         test = TRUE,
         param = FALSE,
         type = "condense")
```

It can also do a total column with the stratified columns (new with `v 1.9.0`) with the `total = TRUE` argument.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
nhanes_2010 %>%
  group_by(asthma) %>%
  table1(age, marijuana, illicit, rehab,
         output = "text2",
         na.rm = FALSE,
         test = TRUE,
         type = "condense",
         total = TRUE)
```

It can also report the statistics in addition to the p-values.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
nhanes_2010 %>%
  group_by(asthma) %>%
  table1(age, marijuana, illicit, rehab,
         output = "text2",
         na.rm = FALSE,
         test = TRUE,
         total = TRUE,
         type = "full")
```

`table1()` can be outputted directly to other formats. All `knitr::kable()` options are available for this and there is an extra option `"latex2"` which provides a publication ready table in Latex documents.

The `tableC()` function gives a well-formatted correlation table.

```{r}
tableC(nhanes_2010, 
       age, active, vig_active, 
       na.rm=TRUE)
```

The `tableF()` function gives a table of frequencies.

```{r}
tableF(nhanes_2010, age)
```

In addition, the `rowmeans()` and `rowsums()` functions offer a simplified use of `rowMeans()` and `rowSums()`, particularly when using the tidyverse's `mutate()`.

```{r}
nhanes_2010 %>%
  select(vig_active, mod_active) %>%
  mutate(avg_active = rowmeans(vig_active, mod_active, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(sum_active = rowsums(vig_active, mod_active, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% 
  head()
```

The `rowmeans.n()` and `rowsums.n()` allow `n` missing values while still calculating the mean or sum.

```{r}
df <- data.frame(
  x = c(NA, 1:5),
  y = c(1:5, NA)
)

df %>%
  mutate(avg = rowmeans.n(x, y, n = 1))
```

## Notes

The package is most useful in conjunction with other tidy tools to get data cleaned/tidied and start exploratory data analysis. I recommend using packages such as `library(dplyr)`, `library(tidyr)`, and `library(ggplot2)` with `library(furniture)` to accomplish this.

The original function--`table1()`--is simply built for both exploratory descriptive analysis and communication of findings. See vignettes or [tysonbarrett.com](https://tysonstanley.github.io/) for several examples of its use. Also see our paper in the [R Journal](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2017/RJ-2017-037/RJ-2017-037.pdf).
